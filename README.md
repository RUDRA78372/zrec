# ZREC - A Zlib recompressor by 78372
## A precomp/antiz alternative
	Usage:
		zrec e/d Input Output
		e/d represents encode/decode
		input/output can be specified as "-" for stdin/stdout
		stdin is not supported while encoding 


Made it back in 2020, deciding to make it open source now. Would do the same for zrec2 as well but zrec code is bad enough to share publicly XD.
